 LibreCAD - Open Source 2D CAD Application
1. Project Overview
LibreCAD is an open-source computer-aided design (CAD) software for creating 2D drawings. It is a lightweight, feature-rich alternative to proprietary CAD software and is widely used for architectural, engineering, and mechanical drawings.

### Key Features:
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Supports DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) for interoperability
- Layer-based drawing system
- Extensive plugin support
- Customizable interface

 2. Breadth-wise Understanding (30%)

### LibreCAD Architecture & Modules
| **Module** | **Functionality** |
|------------|------------------|
| `GUI` | User interface for drawing, editing, and tool access |
| `DXF Library` | Handles reading and writing DXF files |
| `Geometry Engine` | Provides basic geometric calculations |
| `Scripting Interface` | Enables automation using scripts |
| `Plugin System` | Extends functionality with additional features |

### Basic Workflow in LibreCAD
1. Start a new drawing or import an existing DXF file.
2. Use drawing tools (lines, circles, arcs, etc.) to create the design.
3. Organize elements using layers.
4. Save or export the drawing in DXF or other supported formats.

## 3. Depth-wise Analysis (30%)

### Important Features Used
- **Layer Management** - Organize drawings into multiple layers for better editing control.
- **Snapping & Grid System** - Helps with precise alignment of drawing elements.
- **Block Library** - Reuse predefined shapes and symbols in drawings.
- **Customization & Plugins** - Extend functionality via scripts and third-party plugins.

### Core Data Structures
| **Data Structure** | **Usage** |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `RS_Vector` | Stores coordinate points |
| `RS_Entity` | Represents geometric objects like lines and arcs |
| `RS_Layer` | Manages different layers of a drawing |
| `RS_Document` | Stores the entire drawing information |

### Trade-offs & Limitations
- **Lightweight but limited**: Great for 2D CAD but lacks 3D modeling support.
- **Fewer automation tools**: Compared to AutoCAD, LibreCAD has fewer built-in automation features.

 4. C++ Code Examples

1. Load and Display a DXF File
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "rs_document.h"
#include "rs_graphic.h"
#include "rs_dxfreader.h"

int main() {
    RS_Graphic graphic;
    RS_DXFReader reader("drawing.dxf", &graphic);
    
    if (!reader.readDXF()) {
        std::cerr << "Error loading DXF file!" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
    
    std::cout << "DXF file loaded successfully!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

 2. Create a Simple Line in LibreCAD
```cpp
#include "rs_line.h"
#include "rs_graphic.h"

int main() {
    RS_Graphic graphic;
    RS_Vector start(0, 0);
    RS_Vector end(100, 100);
    RS_Line line(nullptr, RS_LineData(start, end));
    
    graphic.addEntity(&line);
    
    std::cout << "Line created successfully!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
